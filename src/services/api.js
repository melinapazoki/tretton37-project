  //     text: " I have been in web development since 2009 and I like to work with people having a growth mindset, a positive attitude towards solving the problem, and keep on experimenting with different things. My approach with any new project is to understand the business first and then jump into technology. It&apos;s good to design a perfect system, but time to market really matters a lot. For me development is a lot like painting a picture, it&apos;s good to fill the painting with colors, but don&apos;t color it too much that it loses its simplicity. I am a big fan of writing test cases especially unit test cases.Other than development I enjoy mentoring people especially the trainees coming from colleges. I have been leading the Java web development Freshers boot camp for the last 10 years.After coding my second love is cooking especially Indian vegetarian food. Whenever I feel low or stressed out I find my kitchen as my best companion. I like to go for a 3-4 day break after every 3-4 months to regain my energy so traveling is also something that I enjoy. In sports, I like to watch Tennis, badminton, cricket, and hockey. ",
